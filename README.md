- 👋 Hi, I’m @zKleb!
- I'm a student at Oklahoma City Community College and wanting to get my toes wet in C++ :)
- I'm majoring in Cybersecurity and hoping to learn some useful skills outside of class.
- 💞️ I’m entirely new to the space and hoping to get experience by collaborating on a wide variety of projects!
- 📫 I can be reached at caleb.redeker@icloud.com
